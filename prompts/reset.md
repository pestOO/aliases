**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: CONTEXT RE-ANCHORING AND TASK FOCUS**

Your attention is locked on obsolete tasks. Execute the following sequence
precisely to re-anchor your focus:

1.  **Conclude and Archive Previous Tasks:** All conversational turns that
    occurred before this directive are now considered concluded and archived.
    Do not treat any previous questions as active or pending.

2.  **Retain Standing Instructions:** DO NOT alter the foundational agreements
    we have established (e.g., output formatting, language, persona, etc.).

3.  **Audit and Report:** List all the standing instructions you are currently
    retaining so I can verify them.

4.  **Re-focus Attention and Define Context Rules:** This is the primary
    directive. From this point forward, you must operate under these two
    rules:
    a. **Prohibition:** You are strictly forbidden from directly answering,
       continuing, or re-addressing any of the archived questions from step 1.
    b. **Permission:** You are permitted and encouraged to use the archived
       information as passive background knowledge to identify patterns,
       understand context, or find connections relevant to **new, future**
       commands.

5.  **Confirm Re-focus and Await:** Confirm that you have re-anchored your
    context according to these rules, then stop and await my next command.
