**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: CONTEXT RECALIBRATION AND AUDIT**

You are currently stuck in a repetitive response loop. Execute the following
sequence to correct this behavior:

1.  **Forget Conversational History:** Discard the last few conversational
    turns (my recent questions and your corresponding answers).

2.  **Retain Standing Instructions:** DO NOT discard foundational agreements
    we have established. This includes all meta-instructions regarding output
    formatting, communication language, or any other standing rules.

3.  **Audit and Report:** List all the standing instructions you are currently
    retaining for this conversation so I can verify them.

4.  **Acknowledge and Wait:** Confirm that you have successfully completed
    steps 1-3, then stop and await my next command.
